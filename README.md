# Prework Notes

## Description

A set of notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript which generates a scripted randomised suggestion on what to study next. The script is written with a view to seamless expansion as more topics are added.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The notes may be reviewed sequentially. Alternatively, open the developer tools in either Chrome or Firefox (Shift-Ctrl-I on Windows, Cmd-Opt-I on MacOS) and check the Console tab for a random suggestion of which topic to study next.
